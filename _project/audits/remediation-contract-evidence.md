# Remediation contract evidence

This record re-derives the accepted remediation claims from their source
instances. The exact test nodes and control outcomes below are the evidence;
the counts are only a replay summary.

## SCD2 validation

The source of truth is the SCD2 operation set in
`benchbox/core/write_primitives/catalog/operations.yaml`. Every operation has
an intended case and a rejected case in
`tests/integration/test_write_primitives_duckdb.py::TestWritePrimitivesSCD2DuckDB`:

- `merge_scd_type2_basic`: `test_scd2_basic_executes_validates_and_cleans_up`
  succeeds; `test_basic_wrong_insert_count_fails_cardinality_bound` rejects an
  under-inserted write.
- `merge_scd_type2_no_change`: `test_scd2_no_change_is_idempotent` succeeds;
  `test_no_change_noop_against_missing_keys_fails_validation` rejects a no-op
  with deleted unchanged keys. `test_no_change_companion_check_is_load_bearing`
  is the vacuity control.
- `merge_scd_type2_new_keys_only`:
  `test_scd2_new_keys_only_inserts_without_closing` succeeds;
  `test_failing_validation_reports_validation_failed_not_success` rejects a
  duplicate current version. `test_new_keys_only_no_rows_closed_scoped_to_new_keys`
  is the cross-operation scope control.

The isolated N2 control deletes unchanged keys 21-40 and applies the real
`merge_scd_type2_no_change` write SQL. The three old offending queries return
zero rows, while `every_unchanged_key_has_current_version_matching_hash`
returns 20 rows. The old query set therefore passes vacuously; the positive
companion rejects the missing persistence state. The SCD2 selection replay
passed 13 tests.

Producer-to-persistence-to-consumer trace: the staging tables and operation
write SQL produce the dimension rows; `scd2_ops_dim_customer` is the
persistence; validation queries and `OperationResult` consume the rows. The
successful, rejected, repeatability, and companion-control nodes exercise that
write-to-validation seam for all three operations.

## Cohort ranking and read-model persistence

The source of truth is `_build_benchmark_summaries` in
`_project/scripts/explorer_pipeline/pipeline.py`, with persisted consumers in
`results`, `benchmark_rankings`, `cohort_metadata`, and
`result_detail_metrics`:

- `test_mismatched_query_sets_are_not_ranked` rejects a cohort whose three
  members have query sets of 197, 206, and 220 IDs; the exclusion is persisted
  as `mismatched_query_set` and every member is ineligible.
- `test_non_rankable_query_gap_does_not_exclude_rankable_peers` rejects the
  incomplete member with `missing_primary_metric` while two complete peers
  remain eligible.
- `test_partial_query_set_does_not_poison_complete_majority` rejects the
  partial member with `mismatched_query_set` while the complete majority stays
  eligible.
- `test_partial_query_set_exclusion_reaches_every_read_model_consumer` runs
  the producer through the real pipeline and verifies the partial member's
  exclusion and ineligibility in all four persisted consumers; the two
  complete peers remain eligible in `benchmark_rankings`.

Producer-to-persistence-to-consumer trace: result bundles produce
`ManifestEntry` and `DetailResult`; `DuckDBSnapshotBuilder` persists the
cohort and result rows; the explorer's result, ranking, cohort-metadata, and
detail views consume those rows. The end-to-end partial fixture is the seam
control for the prior failure mode where a partial input could leave the
downstream read model incomplete or poison peer rankings.

## Publication receipt and journal reconciliation

The authorized receipt producers are the legacy publication workflow and the
publication-transaction workflow. Their durable attestation is stored in the
publication journal; the deploy-time reconciliation consumer compares the
signed receipt identity with the candidate's recorded parent before a Pages
write. The cross-writer contract is exercised by
`tests/unit/workflows/test_publication_rollback.py::test_deploy_revalidates_signed_receipt_identity_across_both_live_receipt_writers`.

The allowed publication seam replay covers both successful and rejected
paths:

- `test_recovery_required_reconciles_forward_to_durable` accepts a successful
  provider observation and commits the durable transaction.
- `test_recovery_reconciliation_requires_succeed_status`,
  `test_recovery_reconciliation_rejects_mismatched_deployment_id`,
  `test_recovery_reconciliation_rejects_missing_deployment_id`,
  `test_recovery_reconciliation_requires_controller_workflow_sha`, and
  `test_recovery_reconciliation_rejects_pre_send_failure` reject mismatched,
  incomplete, stale, or pre-send evidence.
- `test_cas_conflict_detection` rejects a writer using an old journal parent;
  `test_ambiguous_push_failure_reconciles_remote_success` and
  `test_timeout_resolution` distinguish an unknown push outcome from a
  confirmed remote journal head; `test_corrupt_journal_fails_closed` rejects
  missing or invalid persistence state.

## Prescribed replay command

At `checked_sha` (`dd20aed2d53a87a4c34ae74c73a187cfa9bf3c5e`), the prescribed
replay was:

```bash
uv run -- python -m pytest \
  tests/unit/scripts/explorer_pipeline/test_pipeline.py \
  tests/unit/scripts/publication/test_transaction.py \
  tests/unit/scripts/publication/test_journal.py -q
```

The clean detached-worktree result was `111 passed`. The command and pinned
SHA define the replay; the aggregate count is summary evidence only.

The prescribed pipeline and publication seam replay passed 111 tests after
the end-to-end cohort consumer control was added. Re-run the cited nodes after
any source or consumer change; a passing aggregate count is not acceptance of
the collective claim.

## PR #2122 review follow-ups (Tier 3 CLI batch)

Three Codex inline findings on PR #2122 (all unresolved threads at
remediation time), each reproduced before fixing. Producer chain for the
P1 class: `LogicalOperator.to_dict` writes depth-truncation markers,
`.plans.json` persists them, `QueryPlanDAG.from_dict` rehydrates the
companion, and `compare_query_plans` consumes the rehydrated DAGs.

- P1 truncated plans indistinguishable after reload: the pre-fix probe
  (`/tmp/p1_probe.py`, depth-3 chains differing only at the leaf,
  serialized with `max_depth=1`) reloaded STALE/STALE and compared at
  1.0 with zero mismatches.
  `tests/unit/core/query_plans/test_query_plans_comparison.py::TestTruncationCaveat::test_truncated_pair_with_differing_full_fingerprints_is_flagged`
  succeeds (0.867 overall, one `structure_mismatch` carrying the
  truncation reason); the same node failed pre-fix via stash, alongside
  `test_non_truncated_difference_has_no_caveat` failing pre-fix only on
  the new attribute and passing on behavior both before and after.
  `test_truncated_identical_pair_compares_clean` rejects the
  false-positive direction (identically truncated identical plans stay
  at 1.0 with no caveat).
- Truncation preservation at the reload seam:
  `tests/unit/core/results/test_query_plan_models.py::TestTruncationPreservation::test_from_dict_preserves_shallowest_cut`
  succeeds (cut recorded as 2, integrity STALE);
  `test_from_dict_full_depth_has_no_truncation` succeeds (no cut,
  VERIFIED);
  `test_find_truncation_depth_ignores_non_markers` rejects
  non-marker/boolean payloads.
- P2 lazy benchmark import for completion: pre-fix fresh-process probe
  returned `[]` for nyctaxi/joinorder/vector_search while tpch_skew
  completed incidentally.
  `tests/unit/cli/test_benchmark_hooks.py::TestBenchmarkOptionShellCompletion::test_completion_imports_lazy_benchmark`
  succeeds (registry + module entry wiped, completion re-imports and
  still offers `skew_preset=`);
  `test_completion_unknown_benchmark_is_silent` rejects unknown ids
  with no completions; the fresh-process `BashComplete` probe for
  `--benchmark nyctaxi --benchmark-option tax...` now yields
  `taxi_types=`.
- P2 stale run reference: `docs/reference/cli/run.md` stated plain
  `run` has no `--streams` flag in two passages; both now document the
  canonical `--streams` spelling with `--concurrency` as alias, and a
  docs-wide grep finds no remaining `has no --streams` claim.

## Execution-engine provenance through result export

The review of `7eff3646dfa3e9dea10a6be0e3bee32982759a0d` identified two
accepted defects: current Polars engine requests did not affect newly derived
variant identity, and config-only requests disappeared during load/re-export.
The repairs use existing producer evidence without changing published bundles
or assigning new engine suffixes to legacy identities.

The behavioral instances in
`tests/unit/core/results/test_execution_variant_schema.py` are:

- `test_current_polars_producer_request_defines_variant[default]`,
  `[in-memory]`, and `[streaming]`: the actual adapter writes
  `configuration.engine_requested`; the result exporter consumes it to persist
  distinct requested-engine variants. The default control has no engine suffix,
  and no case invents an adapter receipt.
- `test_config_only_engine_request_survives_load_export[default]`,
  `[in-memory]`, and `[streaming]`: `config.execution_engine` is loaded into
  run configuration, persisted by JSON export, and consumed by a second load.
  All requests and unknown applied/observed values survive; no platform receipt
  is synthesized, and the source bundle remains unchanged.
- `test_legacy_engine_request_keeps_existing_identity[None]` and
  `[polars-df]`: legacy explicit streaming evidence remains readable, but both
  missing and already-recorded legacy identity stay `polars-df`, not
  `polars-df+streaming`; source bundles remain unchanged.

These instances and the existing complete-receipt round trip passed together
with CLI export and Explorer transformer tests: 230 passed. Replay with
`uv run -- python -m pytest tests/unit/core/results/test_execution_variant_schema.py tests/unit/cli/test_cli_output.py tests/unit/test_results_exporter.py tests/unit/scripts/explorer_pipeline/test_transformer.py -q`.
## PR #2821 scanner review findings

The nine Oracle findings were reproduced on the pre-fix branch. Each fix keeps
the original source as the durable input; the scanner adapter output is consumed
by the comment-policy parser and its finding rows.

- Shell pipeline masking: the shell source producer writes
  `echo 'pass' | python3 # explanation`; `mask_embedded_sources` now masks
  embedded heredocs only, leaving the shell line for the tokenizer. The
  consumer test is
  `tests/unit/scripts/test_comment_policy.py::test_piped_interpreter_masking_preserves_trailing_shell_comment`;
  it requires the trailing comment and rejects embedded payload leakage.
- Static `echo` and `printf` output: bashlex supplies producer arguments,
  `piped_producer_text` reconstructs supported bytes and formats, and the
  interpreter scanner consumes the reconstructed source. Positive cases,
  including octal escapes, `echo -e`, `%s`, and empty `printf` formats, run in
  `test_piped_producer_payloads_reach_stdin_interpreters` and
  `test_piped_printf_format_is_evaluated`; `test_piped_node_source_reports_javascript_comment`
  exercises the Node consumer. The rejected `%d` conversion and dynamic or
  unsupported producers are controls in
  `test_piped_dynamic_or_unmodeled_stdin_fails_closed`.
- MDX ESM shape recognition: the original MDX source is retained after
  block-comment-tolerant shape validation; `javascript_requests` sends the
  complete statement to the TypeScript scanner. Both inter-token forms are
  exercised end-to-end by `test_mdx_esm_intertoken_comments_are_reported`;
  `test_mdx_prose_import_lookalikes_are_not_code` rejects prose lookalikes.
- Static runner paths with spaces: the shell command AST feeds
  `PythonBindings.runner_payload`, which now tests executable basenames rather
  than rejecting whitespace anywhere in an absolute path. The positive
  `/opt/My Tools/python3` case is in
  `test_python_runner_command_strings_are_scanned`; non-source application
  arguments remain covered by `test_shell_application_arguments_are_not_executable_source`.
- Absolute interpreter paths in pipelines: `SHELL_INLINE_INTERPRETER` now
  admits recognized executable basenames behind a path prefix, so
  `echo '# hidden' | /usr/bin/python3` reaches the consumer scanner. The
  regression is in `test_piped_producer_payloads_reach_stdin_interpreters`.
- Pipeline redirects: descriptor analysis preserves consumer stdout and
  stderr plus producer stderr, while requiring coverage for a consumer stdin
  override. The positive and fail-closed controls are
  `test_piped_unrelated_redirections_preserve_stdin` and
  `test_piped_consumer_stdin_redirection_fails_closed`.
- Bash `echo -e` octal escapes: the decoder treats `\0` followed by up to three
  octal digits as one escape, separately from the `printf` format path.
  `test_piped_producer_payloads_reach_stdin_interpreters` exercises
  `\0043 hidden` as `# hidden`.
- Runner command string ordering: Python runner payloads now scan a complete
  static shell command string before matching an interpreter basename at its
  suffix. `test_python_runner_command_strings_are_scanned` covers a comment
  followed by `/usr/bin/python3`.
- Multiline MDX block comments: statement extraction tracks block-comment
  boundaries before shape validation and passes the complete statement to the
  TypeScript scanner. The multiline case in
  `test_mdx_esm_intertoken_comments_are_reported` requires the comment.


The original focused scanner regressions passed 36 tests; the five additional
fix groups passed 25 tests. The full policy unit file passed 716 tests with
`-n 0`. `make comment-policy-check` scanned 5,749 files with zero violations
and passed all 19 native syntax tests.

### Findings D10-D12

- Split runners: the review's plain `sudo`, `env` and `nohup` forms already
  yielded comment findings on this head. The option-bearing
  `sudo -u nobody python3 -c '# explanation'` form instead returned a coverage
  error. `sudo` and `nohup` now use `runner_command_start` and the registered
  option parser; `env` retains its existing strict `command_words` normalization.
  `test_split_runner_interpreter_arguments_are_scanned` checks eight split forms.
  Unsupported `sudo` and `nohup` flags fail closed in
  `test_unknown_split_runner_options_fail_closed`.
- `printf %%`: before the fix,
  `printf '%%\n# explanation\n' | python3` reconstructed two percent bytes and
  returned a syntax coverage error with the doubled-percent payload. The
  formatter now reconstructs one percent byte. The valid Python fixture in
  `test_piped_printf_escaped_percent_matches_shell_output` asserts the exact
  source bytes reaching the Python scanner.
- Pipeline sides: before the fix,
  `echo '# hidden' | python3 | $dynamic` and
  `echo 'pass' | $interpreter` both returned no findings. The adapter now scans
  the first producer/consumer pair and reports a coverage error for a dynamic
  immediate consumer. The gate ignores the quoted `$$|$${key}` sed delimiter
  and still recognizes unspaced shell pipes. Regressions:
  `test_dynamic_later_pipeline_command_does_not_hide_interpreter_input`,
  `test_dynamic_pipeline_consumer_fails_closed`,
  `test_dynamic_pipeline_consumer_without_spaces_fails_closed`, and
  `test_quoted_pipe_delimiter_does_not_trigger_pipeline_gate`.

The focused D10-D12 regression selection passed 17 tests with
`BENCHBOX_SKIP_TEST_LOCK=1 uv run -- python -m pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_comment_policy.py -k 'split_runner_interpreter_arguments or unknown_split_runner_options or dynamic_pipeline_consumer or dynamic_later_pipeline_command or piped_printf_escaped_percent or quoted_pipe_delimiter' -q -n0`.
The full policy unit file passed 739 tests with
`BENCHBOX_SKIP_TEST_LOCK=1 uv run -- python -m pytest tests/unit/scripts/test_comment_policy.py -q -n0`.
`make comment-policy-check` passed: 5,776 source files, zero violations,
zero enforced failures, and all 19 native syntax tests passed.

The medium-test job now installs the locked TypeScript package in an isolated
temporary directory and exports its module path. A local npm 11.19.1 install
with the same manifest and lockfile passed, and the MDX scanner test passed
four cases using that isolated TypeScript path.
